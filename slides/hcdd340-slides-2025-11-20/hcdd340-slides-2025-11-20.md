## Version Control II

---

## Today
* Version Control
* Project implementation

---

### Recap from last class

---

#### What is Version Control?

**Version control is like an infinite undo button with a perfect memory**

---


#### What is Version Control?

- Tracks every change you make to your files
- Lets you see who changed what and when
- Allows you to rewind to any previous version
- Enables safe collaboration with others

---

#### [Git]{.t-salmon} is a version control system used by [millions]{.t-salmon} worldwide

---


### Git is becoming an [essential]{.t-salmon} skill 

* [Both]{.t-salmon} for designers and developers
* Worth spending time to learn it well

---

### Key concepts
* Repositories
* Commits
* Branches
* Merging

---

### Key concepts
* [**Repositories**]{.t-salmon}
* Commits
* Branches
* Merging



---

### Repository or ("repo")
#### A folder monitored by git

- Contains all your project files
- Stores the complete history of changes

[**One project = One repository**]{.t-salmon}

---

### Creating a Repository

- Choose a folder for your project
- Tell Git to start tracking it
- Git creates a hidden folder to store history


---

### Key concepts
* Repositories
* [**Commits**]{.t-salmon}
* Branches
* Merging


---


#### Commit: A [snapshot]{.t-salmon} of a repo at a given moment

* Commit includes:
    - What changed
    - When it changed
    - Who changed it
    - Why it changed (your message)

---

### Steps to make a commit

1. Make changes to your files
2. Stage the changes you want to save
3. Commit with a clear message

---

#### Writing Good Commit Messages
#### Be clear and descriptive

* ✅ Good examples:
    - "Add introduction paragraph"
    - "Fix typo in chapter 3"
    - "Update bibliography with new sources"

---


#### Writing Good Commit Messages
#### Be clear and descriptive
* ❌ Poor examples:
    - "stuff"
    - "changes"
    - "asdf"

---

#### Commit [early]{.t-salmon}, commit [often]{.t-salmon}

- See exactly what changed and when
- Undo mistakes by going back to earlier commits
- Understand the project's evolution
- Find when bugs were introduced

---

### Key concepts
* Repositories
* Commits
* [**Branches**]{.t-salmon}
* Merging

---

#### Branch: a parallel version of the project


- A safe space to experiment
- A way to work on multiple things at once

---

#### Every repo has a "main" Branch

- Called `main` (or `master` in older repos)
- The primary version of your project
- Usually the "stable" or "official" version

---

#### Reasons for creating other branches

- Try a new idea without risk
- Work on a feature while others work on different features
- Fix a bug while keeping the main version stable

---

### Working with branches

1. Create a new branch for your work
2. Switch to that branch
3. Make commits as usual
4. Switch back to main when needed

Changes in one branch [**don't**]{.t-salmon} affect others

---

### Key concepts
* Repositories
* Commits
* Branches
* [**Merging**]{.t-salmon}


---



#### Merging: combine changes across branches


1. Finish your work on a branch
2. Switch to the branch you want to merge into (usually `main`)
3. Merge your feature branch
4. Delete the feature branch (optional)


---

#### Git automatically combines non-conflicting changes. [But]{.t-salmon} ...

---

#### Merge conflicts 😱 

- Happens when two people edit the same line differently
- Git can't automatically decide which change to keep

---

### Resolving merge conflicts

- Review both versions
- Decide what to keep
- Mark the conflict as resolved
- Complete the merge

---


### Collaboration

---


### Collaboration
#### Key concepts

- **Remote**: A copy of your repo on a server
- **Push**: Send your commits to the remote
- **Pull**: Get others' commits from the remote
- **Clone**: Download a copy of a remote repo

---

### Collaboration workflow

1. **Pull** - Get the latest changes from others
2. **Create a branch** - Make your own workspace
3. **Make commits** - Save your progress
4. **Push** - Share your branch
5. **Merge** - Combine your work with the main branch

---

### Pull requests
#### Asking to merge your changes

"Can I add my work to the main project?"

---

#### Essential commands

- `git init` - Create a new repository
- `git status` - See what's changed
- `git add` - Stage files for commit
- `git commit -m "message"` - Save a snapshot
- `git branch` - List or create branches
- `git merge` - Combine branches

---

## Best practices

- Commit small, complete changes
- Write clear commit messages
- Pull before starting new work
- Create branches for new features
- Don't commit sensitive information (passwords, keys)

---

### When things go wrong

- Git makes it very hard to lose work permanently
- Almost every mistake can be undone
- Check `git status` often to see what's happening

---

## Today
* [**Version Control**]{.t-salmon}
* Project implementation

---

#### Todo — Collaboration in github

* Create a new repo in github for the group
* Clone it in VS Code
* Make following changes
    - Group member 1: Add [.gitignore](https://github.com/hcdd-340/Activity-Fall-2025/blob/main/.gitignore) file
    - Group member 2: Add `index.html`
    - Group member 3: Add `styles.css`

* Merge and push your changes to the github repo

[Useful resource](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)


---


#### Todo — Collaboration in github

* Edit `index.html` — a new `<p>` element
    - Group member 1: Add your favorite holiday
    - Group member 2: Add your favorite food
    - Group member 3: Add your favorite city


* What's the strategy to prevent merge conflict?

---

## Next todos

* Final presentation (12/04)
* Final submission (12/15)
* Mandatory group review (12/16)

---

#### Final presentation requires a [functional PWA]{.t-salmon}

---

#### Final presentation requires a [functional PWA]{.t-salmon}
#### [Some]{.t-clover} features should be completed


---

#### We will work on slides for final presentation [during the class]{.t-salmon} after the break


---

### Todos
* What needs to be completed to show a prototype during the final presentation?
