### Today
#### Implementing layouts for the app

* Complete `html` and `css` rules for a given page
* How would you make sure the layout works for different screen sizes?

---

#### From the syllabus: The app (and the browser version) should work for different devices
* Grading will use responsive design mode for:
    - Desktop
    - Tablet (e.g., 810 x 1080px)
    - Phone (e.g., 375 x 667px)

#### From the syllabus: The app (and the browser version) should work for different devices

* You can choose different layouts for different devices
    + e.g., selectively showing elements

* But, these layouts must be functional and usable across different devices. E.g.,:
    + Text shouldn't cut off in smaller devices
    + Image should be responsive to device width

#### How would you share and merge code?

* Discuss and make a decision
    + Git, zip files, email snippets, ...

* Who is doing what for code management?
    + Who will be merging?
    + Who will keep backups?

### Project template

* You can start from scratch
* Or, you can use class activities with PWA as a starting point
    - E.g., [Activity 17](https://github.com/hcdd-340/Activity-Fall-2025/releases/tag/activity-17.3)
